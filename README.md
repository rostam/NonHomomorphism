# Introduction
In this section, I aim to present a series of results that build upon the definitions outlined in [[1]](#1), specifically those pertaining to Homomorphisms and Nonhomomorphisms. Before delving into the main topics, let's first familiarize ourselves with some essential definitions and established theorems.

Let $G=(V(G),E(G))$ and $H=(V(H),E(H))$ be two graphs. A homomorphism from $G$ to $H$ is a function $f:V(G)â†’V(H)$ such that for every edge $(u,v)$ in $E(G)$, the pair $(f(u),f(v))$ is an edge in $E(H)$. A homomorphism between two graphs doesn't always exist. When a function provides a homomorphism from graph $G$ to $H$, it is denoted as $G\rightarrow H$.

A vertex coloring of a graph is to color vertices with some colors such that no two connected vertices have same colors. The smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices of a graph $G$ is called its chromatic number, and is often denoted by $\chi (G)$. A known [[3]](#3) connection of graph coloring and homomorphism is as follows,
$$
G\rightarrow H \Rightarrow \chi (G)\leq\chi (H)
$$

# NonHomomorphism Factors
The concept of NonHomomorphism Factors was first introduced in [[1]](#1). While the thesis explores various definitions, here we will focus on a particular version to extend upon. Let's define the Non-Homomorphism Factor between two graphs $G$ and $H$,  denoted as $|G,H|$. as the fewest number of edges one must remove from $G$ to establish at lease one homomorphism from $G$ to $H$. So, if there is already a homomorphism from $G$ to $H$, the nonhomomorphism factor is $0$. Here are some more examples:
- $|K_n,K_{n+1}|=0$
- $|K_{n+1},K_n|=1$

Clearly, this factor shows us how far two graphs are from being homomorphic.

# Concentration Parameter
Suppose $G$ is homomorphic to $H$. I introduce a new parameter, $\gamma$, defined as follows. Consider a specific map mm from $G$ to $H$. Let $\alpha$ represent the maximum number of edges in $G$ that are mapped to a single edge in $H$ under this map. There is a similar parameter $M^{\sigma}$ defined in [[2]](#2).for each homomorphism $\sigma$. Now, we define $\gamma(G,H)$ to be the smallest value of $\alpha$ taken over all possible maps from $G$ to $H$.

Once I have defined $\gamma$, we can build upon it to establish various lemmas. Let's propose a few hypothetical lemmas based on the given definition of $\gamma(G, H)$:
- $\gamma(G,G)=0$
- If $G\rightarrow H$, then $\gamma(G,H) > 0$.
- $\gamma(G, H) + \gamma(H,K) \geq \gamma(G,K)$
- If $G\rightarrow H$, then $|G,K| \leq \gamma (G,H)\times|H,K|$.
- If $G\rightarrow H$ and $K\rightarrow H$, then $|G,K| \leq min(\gamma (G,H)\times|H,K|, \gamma (K,H)\times|G,K|)$
- If $G\rightarrow H$ and $H$ is both vertex- and edge-transitive, then $\gamma(G,H) \leq \frac{|E(G)|}{|E(H)|}$

If there is no homomorphism from $G$ to $H$ then we need to define $\gamma$. Maybe, a logical way is to define it as inifinite??

# Extras
In the thesis, a function $d$ is also defined which is improved to be a metric measure as follows:
- $d(G,H) = max(|G,H|,|H,G|)$

So, this metric $d$ possesses the following properties for any two graphs $G$ and $H$:
- $d(G,H) \geq 0$ (Non-negativity)
- $d(G,G) = 0$  (Identity of indiscernibles, partially)
- $d(G,H) = d(H,G)$  (Symmetry)
- $d(G,H) + d(H,K) > d(G,K)$  (Triangle inequality)

For the property of Identity of indiscernibles, we need to consider classes of graph in which they are homomorphic to each other.
