# NonHomomorphism Factors
NonHomomorphism Factors are defined first in the thesis of Kaveh Khoshkhah. There are different definitions in the thesis, but I just introduce one version based on which I want to extend the topic. So, let us define a Nonhomomorphism factor between two graphs $G$ and $H$ (shown with $|G,H|$) as the minimum number of edges that we should remove from $G$ such that we have at lease one homomorphism from $G$ to $H$. So, if there is already a homomorphism from $G$ to $H$, the nonhomomorphism factor is $0$. Here are some more examples:
- $|K_n,K_{n+1}|=0$
- $|K_{n+1},K_n|=0$
